## Election Audit Summary: 

   This audit initially started with few requirements and then in order to support the additional requirements of the election commission the script was modified to support their request.  This is a real time example of how the script can be modified for future elections in any locality and at various levels of government.  This script can be modified to produce more specific results for a particular city or wide and high up as a national level.  This script can be as basic or detailed as the data collected.
